# image_enhancer_with_ESRGAN 
An interactive Jupyter-based application that enhances image resolution using a pre-trained ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) model from TensorFlow Hub, with real-time brightness adjustment through LAB color space manipulation. Interactive ipywidgets for image upload and brightness control, applied advanced image preprocessing using SciKit-Image, and visualization results using Matplotlib.

# 📸 Super-Resolution with Brightness Adjustment using ESRGAN

This project allows you to enhance the resolution of any uploaded image and dynamically adjust its brightness using a pre-trained ESRGAN model from TensorFlow Hub. It provides an interactive interface powered by Jupyter Widgets and supports real-time image processing, brightness tuning, and side-by-side visual comparisons.

# 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Upload your own image** via an intuitive widget interface.
- 🔍 **Super-resolution enhancement** using ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN).
- 🌈 **Brightness control slider** for fine-tuning output image luminance.
- 🔬 **Zoomed-in comparison** to highlight improvement in image quality.
- 🧠 Integrated with TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and SciKit-Image for deep learning and image processing.
