# image_enhancer_with_ESRGAN-
Built an interactive Jupyter app to enhance image resolution using a pre-trained ESRGAN model from TensorFlow Hub. Included real-time brightness adjustment via LAB color space, image upload with ipywidgets, advanced preprocessing using SciKit-Image, and visual comparisons with Matplotlib.
